# JarvisBot

#### About
I created a Discord Bot, called Jarvis using the Discord library. Jarvis moderates my personal Discord Server and can assist with administrative issues. I created various commands that can ensure maintenance in the server. Basic commands are below but I am consistently updating this, so more commands will be updated.

#### Commands

!8Ball - Rolls 8 ball with responses

!Kick - Kicks user

!Ban - Ban user

!Unban - Remove user from ban list

!Load - Loads in command from cogs

!Unload - Unload command from cogs

#### Learning Outcomes
From this project, I was able to create a bot that responds to commands. I learned how to use various Python libraries and further my understanding of object oriented programming.
